            <p class="center-text">Animal Alliance of Canada (AAC) believes in the protection of all animals and to the promotion of a harmonious relationship among humans, non-humans and the environment. We do this by using electoral politics and lobbying as strategies to make the legislators pass sound animal and environmental protection laws.</p>
            <p class="center-text">AAC is a federally incorporated non-profit organization, founded in August of 1990. We have supporters across Canada and are funded entirely by private donations.</p>

                        <h4>Legislating Change</h4>
                        <p>Since its inception, Animal Alliance has worked to create long term, positive change for animals and the environment. This progress is accomplished by engaging in electoral politics and lobbying for legislation that better protects animals and the environment we share.

                        <p><span class="bold">Institutionalized Cruelty:</span> Whether it’s the killing of wild animals in the name of ‘management’, cruelty in transportation of farmed animals, or the commercial slaughter of wildlife, Animal Alliance will continue to fight injustice wherever we find it. The lives of animals matter – and we continue to fight for those who cannot speak for themselves.</p>

                        <p>In 2005, Animal Alliance of Canada created the Animal Alliance Environment Voters Party of Canada (now the Animal Protection Party of Canada) – a federally registered political party and North America’s first political party focused exclusively on environmental and animal protection.</p>
                        
                        <p>We have the knowledge, experience and expertise to give progressive environmental and animal protection policies political relevance at the municipal, provincial and federal levels of government.</p>

                        <p>We rescue animals before they are sent to research. We also rescue and rehabilitate animals who have been exploited in research labs, primarily cats and dogs. We have also rescued and rehomed small animals, as well as cows, sheep, rabbits, chickens, and ducks.</p>
                        
                        <p>We network with caring shelter workers to help those animals that who are unable to cope well with the shelter environment; very young, senior or otherwise traumatized animals. We take these animals out of the shelter setting and care for them in foster homes until we can adopt them into loving, responsible homes.</p>
                        
                        <p>No matter how animals come to us, we provide them safe shelter, veterinary care, and the training needed to prepare them for their successful adoption.</p>
